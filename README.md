# cassandana
Cassandana is an open source MQTT message broker which is entirely written in Java. This project began its life as a fork of [Moquette](http://andsel.github.io/moquette/) , and later underwent some major cleanup, optimization and adding extra features. Now itâ€™s ready to work as an enterprise message broker.
